h1. Textmate Bundle for Cucumber

This is a fork of the "cucumber-tmbundle":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-tmbundle.
The goal is to keep the same functionality that the original bundle had but make it compatible with Bundler v1.

h3. Background

Bundler does not generate .bundle/environment.rb files any more. If you need help using Bundler 1.0, I suggest you read the docs at gembundler.com, which cover v1.0.


h2. Installation

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
rm -rf Cucumber.tmbundle
git clone git://github.com/lpsBetty/cucumber-tmbundle.git Cucumber.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
</pre>

* In TextMate: From your drop down menu, select Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles.


h2. Usage

* In TextMate: For a test run open a feature file and press Cmd+R or select Bundles -> Cucumber -> Run Feature
